Feature: Test the validations done on fields from PlatformUI - text line fieldtype
    In order to validate the text line fieldtype
    As an Editor user
    I need to be able to create and update content with text line fieldtypes

    Background:
       Given I am logged in as an 'Administrator' in PlatformUI

    ##
    # Validate the existence of expected fields from a field type when creating a content
    ##
    @javascript
    Scenario: A Content of a Content Type that has a text line fieldtype must have a text field
        Given a Content Type with a "text line" Field exists
        When I create a content of this type
        Then I should see a "text line" field

    @javascript
    Scenario: When editing a Content, the label of a text line field must have the same name than field type from the respective Content Type
        Given a Content Type with a "text line" with field definition name "Test text" exists
        When I create a content of this type
        Then I should see a "Test text" label related with the "text line" field

    @javascript
    Scenario: The label of a required text line field of a Content must be marked as required
        Given a Content Type with a required "text line" with field definition name "Required" exists
        When I create a content of this type
        Then the "Required" field should be marked as required

    Scenario: Creating a required text line Field fails validation when using an empty value
        Given a Content Type with a required "text line" Field exists
        When I create a content of this type
        And I set an empty value as the Field Value
        And I publish the content
        Then Publishing fails with validation error message "This field is required"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Creating a valid text line Field works when using a value within limited character scope
        Given a Content Type with a "text line" Field exists with Properties:
            | Validator                | Value |
            | minimum length validator | 2     |
            | maximum length validator | 4     |
